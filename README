Hi, My name if Max Johnson. Some people call me Gummy. I enjoy coding as a hobby, and I like to improve 
my abilities in coding. I play many a game, Far Cey 3, Battlefield 3, Chivalry, but primarily minecraft.
If you want to contact me, I am often on the minecraft server realmsofminecraft.dyndns.org. You can also
email me at Gumyplugins@yahoo.com. Thanks for reading this pointless bio, have a nice day!
